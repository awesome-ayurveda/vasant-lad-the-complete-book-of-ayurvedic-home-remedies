# Acknowledgments

The author would like to acknowledge those whose dedication and insight brought the knowledge of Ayurveda to the world, especially his teachers who lovingly showed the way and shared their knowledge and experience. He would also like to express his gratitude to the following people, without whose contributions this book would not exist: his loving wife, Usha, and his children, Pranav and Aparna, for their love, patience, and support during the writing of this book; Wynn Werner and the Ayurvedic Institute staff for their help with the original outline, the various drafts, and for raising important points during this process; Jack Forem for proposing the idea for the book, and for help writing, organizing, and editing the material in a clear and enjoyable style. At Harmony Books, appreciation to Leslie Meredith and Peter Guzzardi for believing in the project, and to Joanna Burgess for her exacting attention in bringing the book to production.
