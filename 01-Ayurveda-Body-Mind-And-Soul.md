# Chapter 1
# Ayurveda: Body, Mind, and Soul

Like other great ancient civilizations, India never separated science from philosophy and religion. Rather, it viewed all knowledge as part of a whole designed to promote human happiness, health, and growth.

_Philosophy_ is the love of truth. _Science_ is the discovery of truth through experiment. _Religion_ is the experience of truth and application of it in daily living.

Ayurveda, the science of life, is both systematized knowledge and practical wisdom, an art of healthy living that encompasses all phases of life: body, mind, and spirit. Like all sciences, it includes both a practical and a theoretical aspect. In order to make the best use of the practical recommendations that come later in this book, it will help if you understand the essentials of Ayurvedic theory. This first chapter may seem a bit abstract, but please be patient and read it carefully, as it forms the basis of all that is to follow.

## The Universe and How We Are Connected

According to Ayurveda, the source of all existence is universal Cosmic Consciousness, which manifests as male and female energy. _Purusha_, often associated with the male energy, is choiceless, passive, and pure awareness. _Prakruti_, the female energy, is active and choiceful consciousness. Both _Purusha_ and _Prakruti_ are eternal, timeless, and immeasurable. These two energies are present in all living organisms, including every man and woman, as well as inanimate objects.

_Purusha_ is formless and beyond attributes. Unmanifested pure existence, beyond cause and effect, beyond space and time, _Purusha_ takes no active part in creation but remains a silent witness.

_Prakruti_, which has form, color, and attributes, is the divine creative will that dances the dance of creation. _Prakruti_ is the One that becomes many. _Purusha_ is the lover, and _Prakruti_ is the beloved. The creation of this universe happens through their love. All of nature is the child born from the womb of _Prakruti_, the Divine Mother.

In the manifestation of nature from _Prakruti_, the first expression is _Mahad_ (or _Mahat_), intelligence or cosmic order. (In human beings, it is referred to as _Buddhi_, intellect.) Next is _Ahamkar_ or ego, the sense of self-identity, the center in our consciousness from which we think, act, and react. _Ahamkar_ expresses itself in three universal qualities:
- _Sattva_ is stability, purity, wakefulness, essence, clarity, and light.
- _Rajas_ is dynamic movement and causes sensations, feelings, and emotions.
- _Tamas_ is the tendency toward inertia, darkness, ignorance, and heaviness. _Tamas_ is responsible for deep sleep and periods of confusion. It also leads to the creation of matter.

From the essence of _Sattva_ are born the mind, the five sense faculties and their organs (ears to hear, skin to perceive touch, eyes to see, tongue to taste, nose to smell), and the five motor organs or organs of action: the mouth (for speech), the hands, feet, reproductive organs, and organs of excretion.

_Rajas_ is the active force behind the movement of both the sensory and motor organs.

_Tamas_ gives rise to the five elements, which form the basis of material creation: space (ether), air, fire, water, and earth.

Man, a creation of Cosmic Consciousness, is considered to be a microcosm of the macrocosm that is the universe. Whatever is present in the cosmos, the same is present in human beings. Man is a miniature of nature.
